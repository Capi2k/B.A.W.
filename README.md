# B.A.W
##Basic Ass Website
###What is the B.A.W
the B.A.W is my first attempt at creating a html site, that uses css. I never had an education with focus on html and css and want to acquire some basic knowledge. At the same time I want to have an environment where I can try out all the stuff I ever wanted to try out on an actual website. Meaning there is a lot of stuff I want to implement. This will also include certain JS, which is also great to strengthen.
